# Sobre nosotros

There are several ways to connect nodes, depending on your setup and personal preference. You can either tap one port and then the other, or drag from one port to the other. If you are zoomed out, you can open the node context menu by tap-and-hold or secondary click. Then you can tap one of the the expanded port names to start a connection.
